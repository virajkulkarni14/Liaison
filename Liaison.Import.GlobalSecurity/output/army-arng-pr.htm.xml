        <Contents>The Puerto Rico Army National Guard maintains 48 armories, and is present in 30 communities. The Puerto Rico National Guard, like the National Guards in all 50 states, is a hybrid organization. National Guards are ordinarily under the control of state (or, in the case of Puerto Rico, Commonwealth) officials, but are organized pursuant to federal statute, and in war time or other emergencies, Guard units may be brought under federal control. Puerto Rico Army National Guard and Reserve units support USARSO's many multilateral exercises and programs. It is through this integration of our Active Army, National Guard, and Reserves that US Army South  [USARSO] can maximize resources to carry out missions.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1989, Congress authorized federal funding to permit the local National Guards to support drug interdiction and other counter-drug activities. 32 U.S.C. § 112. Section 112 provided that each state desiring to participate would draw up its own plan subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense. Despite this and other authority over the program granted to the Secretary of Defense, the statute required that the National Guard personnel involved in these operations be under local control and "not in Federal service," id. § 112(c)(1), a requirement apparently designed to mesh with the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1385, limiting the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement purposes.</Contents>

Section 112 itself provided that subject to Secretary of Defense regulations, local National Guard members could, pursuant to a state plan, "be ordered to perform full-time National Guard duty under section 502(f) of this title for the purpose of carrying out drug interdiction and counter-drug activities." 32 U.S.C. § 502(f) allows National Guard personnel to be assigned additional duties, apart from ordinary drills and field exercises, with the provision appropriate for "pay and allowances."</Contents>

        <Contents>The Puerto Rico National Guard claims to be a direct descendant of the original  militia that existed on the Island since the time of the Spanish conquest and colonization at the beginning of XVI century.  Four years after the militia establishment by Juan Ponce de Leon.  The Puerto Rican Indians, called Tainos, rebelled in 1511.  The Spanish men (mostly farmers and mine workers) had to quit their jobs to take arms and defend their adopted land.  Since that unconfirmed date in 1511 when Taino Indians killed Cristobal de Sotomayor and burned the town named in his honor, the Borinquen colonists had to form, by necessity,  a sort of National Guard unit with citizens as its soldiers.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Milicias Urbanas de Puerto Rico was first organized in 1693 and reorganized in 1765 as the Milicias Diciplinadas de Puerto Rico. After the Lares Uprising of 1868, the Spanish doubting the loyalty of Puerto Ricans, began to disband these companies, including the Compania de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. The milicias, are the direct lineal ancestors of two of today's Puerto Rico National Guard Units, the 295th and 296th Infantry. The milicias were replaced in 1871 by another similar organization, El Instituto de Voluntarios.</Contents>

        <Contents>In 1899, the U.S. Congress authorized the establishment of a military unit comprised of Puerto Ricans and in 1900 the Porto Rico Battalion was established. Through successive reorganizations this unit became the Porto Rico Voluntary Infantry, The Porto Rican Provisional Regiment of Infantry, the Porto Rico Regiment, U.S. Infantry and finally in 1920, the 65th Regiment, U.S. Infantry. The Puerto Rico National Guard eventually became the 296th Infantry Regiment ("Alerta Esta" - "Always Alert").</Contents>

        <Contents>The Porto Rico Regiment, U.S. Infantry, 4,000 strong, served in World War I. From 1917 to 1919 it guarded the Panama Canal. During this period, the Porto Rico National guard also came into existence with the creation of the 295th and 296th  Infantry Regiments. Additionally, several "Home Guard" units were organized and many other Puerto Ricans living in the continental U.S. served in mainland units that fought in Europe. Dark skinned Puerto Ricans were placed in such racially segregated units as the 396th Infantry, "The Harlem Hell Fighters" who fought under French command. Rafael Hernandez the famous Puerto Rican musician/composer and his brother, Jesus, served in that unit's band. All told, 236,000 Puerto Ricans registered for the WWI draft and 18,000 served in the military.</Contents>

The new headquarters came into federal service on 15 October 1940, but served less than two years without seeing combat. In July 1942 the Caribbean Defense Command inactivated the brigade and replaced it with the Puerto Rican Mobile Force</Contents>

        <Contents>It has been estimated that anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 Hispanics  served in the armed forces during World War II. This represents a range of 2.5 to 5% of all persons who served during the war. Figures are imprecise because, with the exception of Puerto Ricans, data on Hispanics were not maintained. Over 53,000 Puerto Ricans served during the period 1940-1946. National guard units from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California had a high representation of Mexican Americans. The US Army has never segregated Hispanic soldiers. The Puerto Rico National Guard was called into Federal Active Service in October 1940, and assigned to the Puerto Rican Department in accordance with the existing War Plan Orange.  Members of Puerto Rico's National Guard, of the present 65th USA Reserve Command, and of its ancestors, the 65th Infantry Regiment and the 1899 Puerto Rican Regiment US Volunteers, were residents of the island. Approximately 200 Puerto Rican women served in the Women's Army Corps.</Contents>

        <Contents>Puerto Rico Army National Guard (PRARNG) support to the Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) is the longest sustained support to a law enforcement mission in modern U.S. history. Targets are drug dealers and other criminal elements. The Puerto Rico National Guard (PRNG) has concentrated on the Homeland Defense  [HLD] mission by fighting drug-related crime on the island and providing humanitarian relief to the communities affected by the drug trade. The PRNG concentrates on support to domestic civil authorities, counterdrug operations and humanitarian assistance. During Operation Centurion in 1996, PRNG units and the police moved into 76 housing projects to arrest dealers and criminals and restore community order. Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Rossello created the program to reinforce limited Puerto Rico LEA assets and drive out drug traffickers from housing areas. The secondary objective was to restore normalcy to communities through a coordinated security and social effort. Soldiers from aviation and military police units supported the police in the initial cordon, search, seizure and arrest phase. Once the target area was cleared of identifiable criminal elements, infantry, artillery, engineer and maintenance personnel helped community agencies rebuild housing complexes, distribute antidrug literature, rehabilitate facilities and dispose of garbage.</Contents>

        <Contents>The program was a resounding success, and the PRNG's skills and resources were paramount. Unfortunately, in terms of active force integration, this wealth of operational experience was misdirected. The PRNG applied and exercised MOOTW doctrine, not conventional war-fighting practices. They used valuable training days that could have been used for collective combat training. They also built close cooperation, reinforced habitual relationships and integrated with police and various social agencies-not with AC combat forces.</Contents>

        <Contents>Operation FRONTIER SHIELD was introduced in fiscal year 1997 to test this concept in the maritime approaches to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This region was identified as the second largest gateway, behind the Southwest Border, for drugs entering the United States and provided an emergent opportunity to create an immediate and measurable impact. Operation FRONTIER SHIELD demonstrates the tangible positive impacts of interdiction in Puerto Rico. In 1997, drug related crime was down 37 percent from the year before and the Governor no longer needed the Puerto Rico National Guard to maintain order in the housing areas. On the streets of San Juan cocaine purity went down and street prices rose nearly 36 `percent throughout 1997.</Contents>

During FY99, the PRARNG was recognized as one of the most versatile and best prepared state militias of the United States.  FY99 began with troops supporting the Island's communities recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Georges.  Soldiers were summoned to perform disaster relief operations and engineering support for road clearance and debris removal.</Contents>

        <Contents>The PRARNG also supported communities using their specialized skills.  Medical units provided preventive health care, education, and immunizations in low-income neighborhoods.  Guard members served drug and law enforcement agencies through its Counter Drug Program, resulting in the confiscation of millions of dollars in illegal drugs.  The PRNG is the only organization in the US conducting all three NGB-sponsored youth programs: STARBASE, Youth Conservation Corps, and Challenge. At the international level, the 113th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment deployed to Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador in support of Hurricane Mitch disaster relief.  Aviation units provided helicopter support to Joint Task Force Esteli in Nicaragua as part of the US Southern Command Exercise New Horizons '99.  The PRARNG also commenced the State Partnership Program with the Republic of Honduras.</Contents>

        <Contents>Buff and scarlet are the colors traditionally used by Support organizations. Red represents courage and zeal; gold is emblematic of honor and high achievement. The blue shield and wavy chief reflect the location of the battalion in the Caribbean. The crossed sword and key underscore the unit's mission, while the embattled chevron symbolizes strength and support and highlights fortification and defense. The five battlements represent combat service support's sustaining imperatives (anticipation, continuity, responsiveness, integration, and improvisation). The sentry box reflects the organization's cultural heritage within the Puerto Rico area of operation. Red and gold reflect the Spanish history of the island.</Contents>

        <Contents>The shoulder sleeve insignia was authorized on 16 June  1964. The colors blue and white are used for Infantry. The blue area and white wavy base (Waves) refer to the Caribbean and the white disc to the Island of Puerto Rico, the white disc also simulating a pearl, Puerto Rico being known as the "Pearl of the Antilles." The furison, a steel device for striking against flint to create a fire, is an ancient heraldic symbol and simulates a battle sight on a rifle. Furisons also form links in the collar (chain) of the Order of the Golden Fleece, the foremost Spanish order of chivalry, and refer to the discovery and settlement of Puerto Rico by the Spanish. In this instances, the blue area within the furison refers to San Juan Harbor, the opening between the arms of the furison alluding to "puerto" a harbor and the yellow (gold) furison itself to the surrounding land area and natural opulence (rico) of the island. The cross on the furison alludes to San Juan and appears on the banner in the crest of the Puerto Rican National Guard. The cross in this instance is red, yellow (gold) and red being the colors of Spain.</Contents>

        <Contents>The distinctive unit insignia was authorized for the noncolor bearing units of the 92d Infantry Brigade on 19 April 1967, with the motto amended on 12 Jun 1967. The red sentry tower was suggested by El Morro at San Juan and the yellow disc alludes to the tropical sun, red and yellow also being the colors of the Spanish who discovered and first settled in Puerto Rico. The machetes refer to the cutting of sugar cane, a major source of wealth in the Island, and are also extremely effective offensive weapons. Crossed in front of the sentry tower, they allude to constant vigilance and readiness to defend Puerto Rico. Blue, red and yellow are also the colors of the three major combat arms and the motto "A Lo Que Vinimos" which may roughly be translated "On Our Way" reflects the intensity of power and the spirit of the Brigade.</Contents>

        <Contents>During World War II, the 65th remained in Puerto Rico until January 1943, when it moved to Panama and then to France in September 1944. However, the Army did not have any confidence in the fighting ability of the 65th. This prejudice was based on preconceived notions. In reality, the 65th was a well-trained and proud outfit. Although the 3rd Battalion saw some fighting in Italy, most of the 65th was assigned to headquarters as security troops. After the war, the 65th returned to garrison duty in Puerto Rico. An exercise involving the 65th in February 1950 changed the minds of many Army leaders about the 65th's usefulness. The 65th held off the entire 3rd Infantry Division in a successful defense. Pentagon planners took note.</Contents>

        <Contents>With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the 65th was ordered to Korea and assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. Between September 1950 and December 1951, the 65th Infantry Regiment established a reputation as one of the 3rd Infantry Division's most dependable formations in Korea. Manned by Puerto Rican troops and commanded by predominantly white officers, the regiment was a well-led, well-trained and disciplined formation. On Feb. 2, 1951 the 65th U.S. Infantry Regiment mounted the  last
recorded battalion-sized bayonet attack by the US Army.</Contents>

        <Contents>The regiment's combat effectiveness, however, deteriorated rapidly in 1952. The 65th experienced its first major failures at Outpost Kelly and Jackson Heights in the Ch'orwon Valley of North Korea during September and October 1952. Losing both outposts to sustained Chinese attacks and failing to regain them, the regiment suffered more than 500 battle casualties in one month. Afterward, 95 men of the regiment were court-martialed and convicted of desertion, misbehavior before the enemy and disobeying the orders of a superior officer. Other infantry regiments in Korea experienced deterioration analogous to that of the 65th, and some displayed similar shortcomings on the battlefield as well. Factors within the 65th contributing to the failure included a catastrophic shortage of NCOs, language problems and inept leadership in a few key positions. One cannot overstate the damage done by the large-scale diversion to other units of the bilingual NCOs originally intended for assignment to the 65th. The reliable link between an English-speaking Army and the regiment's Spanish-speaking soldiers simply disappeared.</Contents>

While the 65th was on its way, its sister Puerto Rico Guard unit, the 296th Infantry, was mobilized. Like many Guard units, the 296th was tasked to provide replacements. Most Puerto Rico Guardmembers were assigned to the 65th.</Contents>

        <Contents>The Army School System is geographically divided into regions to promote coordination, resource management, and standards.  Command responsibility for ARNG units is vested in the state and territorial governors who execute their responsibilities through State Adjutants General (TAGs). The TAGs provide command and control of the ARNG TASS activities within their state/territory.</Contents>

        <Contents>The coat of arms was originally approved for the 123rd Coast Artillery Battalion on 18 August 1942. It was redesignated for the 123rd Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion on 3 August 1951. On 31 July 1961 the coat of arms was rescinded (cancelled). The coat of arms was approved in 30 October 1997, with blazon and symbolism revised, for the 201st Regiment. The service of the former organization, the 123rd Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion, is indicated by the Man-O-War bird which represents a possible enemy. The spear depicts the elimination of an aircraft from the skies. The sentry box represents the constant defense of the skies and stars are indicative of the battalion number.</Contents>
